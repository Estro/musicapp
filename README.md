# Music App

## Installation

```bash
npm install
bower install
gulp
```
This assumes you have gulp globally installed (npm install -g gulp). If you do not have / want gulp globally installed, you can run npm run gulp instead.

Secondly, you need to have cordova and ionic cli installed (npm install -g cordova and npm install -g ionic.)
